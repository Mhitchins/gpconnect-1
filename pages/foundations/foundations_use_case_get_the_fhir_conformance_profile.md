| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `Ssp-TraceID`        | Consumer's TraceID (i.e. GUID/UUID) |
| `Ssp-From`           | Consumer's ASID |
| `Ssp-To`             | Provider's ASID |
| `Ssp-InteractionID`  | `urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:read:metadata`|

### Request Response ###

#### Response Headers ####

Provider systems are not expected to add any specific headers beyond that described in the HTTP and FHIR&reg; standards.

#### Payload Response Body ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return a `200` **OK** HTTP status code on successful retrival of the conformance statement.
- SHALL ensure that the FHIR version number returned by the FHIR server endpoint conformance statement matches the FHIR version stated in the endpoint base URL. Refer to [Spine Directory Services](integration_spine_directory_service.html) for details of the format of the FHIR base URL to be used. 

An example GP Connect Conformance Statement of type `Instance` is shown below ready for customisation and embedding into GP Connect assured provider systems.

Consumer Systems:

- SHALL, during development, request the conformance statement from the FHIR server endpoint in order to ascertain details of the implementation of GPConnect capabilities delivered by the FHIR server.
- SHOULD, at run-time, request the conformance statement from the FHIR server endpoint in order to ascertain details of the implementation of GPConnect capabilities delivered by the FHIR server.
- SHOULD cache conformance statement information retrieved from an endpoint at run-time on a per-session basis. 

### C# client request to get the conformance statement ###

{% include tip.html content="C# code snippets utilise Ewout Kramer's [fhir-net-api](https://github.com/ewoutkramer/fhir-net-api) library which is the official .NET API for HL7&reg; FHIR&reg;." %}

```csharp
var client = new FhirClient("http://gpconnect.fhir.nhs.net/fhir/");
client.PreferredFormat = ResourceFormat.Json;
var resource = client.Conformance();
FhirSerializer.SerializeResourceToXml(resource).Dump();
```
