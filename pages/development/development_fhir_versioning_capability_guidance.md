### Capability pack / interaction versioning ###

For each of the five capability packs (`Foundations`, `Access Record HTML`, `Access Record Structured`, `Appointment Management`, `Task Management`) there are a number of `API Use Cases` which make up the capability pack, for example "Find a patient" and "Read an organization" are two of the API Use Cases within the Foundation capability pack.

Each API Use Case has an associated InteractionID. The InteractionID for each API Use Case is specified within the relevant Capability Packs, for example the "Find a patient" interaction is listed in the [Spine Interactions for the Foundations Capability Pack](foundations.html#spine-interactions).

InteractionsIDs in early versions of the specification did not contain a version number, but going forward a major version number will now be added. A new version of the interaction will be issued when there is a breaking change made within the interaction, for example if a Profiled FHIR resources used as part of the interaction is changed but is not backwardly compatible with the previous versions of the profiled FHIR resources, this would result in a new major version of the interaction.

Example of InteractionID versioning:

| Interaction-ID | Reason for interaction version |
| --- | --- |
| urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:operation:gpc.getcarerecord | Initial InteractionID used for "Access Record HTML 1.0.0-rc.5". |
| urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:operation:gpc.getcarerecord-2 | A Profiled FHIR Resource breaking change from "GPConnect-Patient-1" FHIR resource to "CareConnect-GPC-Patient-1" FHIR Resource. |
| urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:operation:gpc.getcarerecord-3 | This will be the next InteractionID which will be used for the next breaking change to the Access Record HTML interaction. |


#### Provider supported versions ####

Providers are expected to maintain both the current and previous version of each interaction as they are released with changes to the specification. ie. "n" and "n-1" where n is the currently version of the interaction within the latest specification and n-1 is the previous version of the interaction.

The requirement for a provider to maiantain both the latest version and the previous version is to maintain interoperability between systems as each of the providers and consumers uplift their product to support the latest version of each interaction.  

Example of a providers endpoint and supported interactions:

| Interaction | Version |
| --- | --- |
| ~~urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:operation:gpc.getcarerecord~~ | n-2 (interaction can be removed) |
| urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:operation:gpc.getcarerecord-2 | n-1 |
| urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:operation:gpc.getcarerecord-3 | n |
| urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:search:patient | n-1 |
| urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:search:patient-2 | n |
| urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:read:appointment | n |

Providers SHALL register an endpoint within the SDS for each IntereactionId supported by the FHIR server on the Principal GP system. Information on registering endpoints can be found on the [Spine Directory Services](integration_spine_directory_service.html#provider-system-viewpoint) page.


### FHIR resource versioning ###

#### Major FHIR resource profile versions ####

The versioning of profiled FHIR resources will follow the other versioning within the specification where a breaking change will result in a major version change and non-breaking changes will result in a minor version change. The FHIR Resource Profile names contain the major version number for the Profiled FHIR Resource, for example "CareConnect-GPC-Organization-2" is version two of the Organization resource profile. A breaking change will result in a new major version and therefore new FHIR Resource Profile will be created, the name containing that new major version.

Example Profiled FHIR Resource version changes:

| FHIR resource profile name| Example reason for version change |
| --- | --- |
| CareConnect-GPC-Patient-1 | Starting Profiled FHIR resource. |
| CareConnect-GPC-Patient-2 | A change to add a mandatory field to the Profiled FHIR Resource. |
| CareConnect-GPC-Patient-3 | A change to restrict the cardinality of a field from "0..*" to "1..1". |

#### Minor FHIR resource profile versions ####

Minor version changes will not result in a change to the FHIR Resource Profile. All the FHIR Resource profiles are made available on the [FHIR Reference Server](https://fhir.nhs.uk/StructureDefinition), the minor version of the FHIR Resource Profile are available using the standard FHIR "_history" capability to specify the exact version of the resource definition that you wish to retrieve. For Example:

| URL to use for FHIR Reference Server | Version of profile which will be returned|
| --- | --- |
| https://fhir.nhs.uk/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-GPC-Organization-1/_history/1.1 | Minor Version 1.1 |
| https://fhir.nhs.uk/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-GPC-Organization-1/_history/1.2 | Minor Version 1.2 |

If the Profiled FHIR Resource is changed with a new major version this will probably also result in an uplift to the InteractionID  for that capability.

#### Resource identifiers ####

If a new profile is created for a fhir resource the providers fhir server should return the same the logical identifier within the fhir resources whichever profile is used when returning the data for that resource. For example:

| Request | Returned profiled resource | Logical ID within resource |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /Patient/3 | CareConnect-GPC-Patient-1 | 20bc84b8-3e02-4da2-b2e8-702562bc53bc |
| /Patient/3 | CareConnect-GPC-Patient-2 | 20bc84b8-3e02-4da2-b2e8-702562bc53bc |


### Valueset versioning ###
Valuesets are not currently versioned and GP Connect is aware there is a risk surrounding this and the affects it may have on the capabilities if valuesets are uplifted. If a valueset is altered or uplifted the risk will be managed at the time.
